Text data is increasingly important in many domains, and tidy data principles and tidy tools can make text mining easier and more effective. In this workshop, learn how to manipulate, summarize, and visualize the characteristics of text using these methods and R packages from the tidy tool ecosystem. These tools are highly effective for many analytical questions and allow analysts to integrate natural language processing into effective workflows already in wide use. Explore how to implement approaches such as sentiment analysis of texts, measuring tf-idf, network analysis of words, and building both supervised and unsupervised text models.\nIs this workshop for me?\nThis course will be appropriate for you if you answer yes to these questions:\nHave you ever encountered text data and suspected there was useful insight latent within it but felt frustrated about how to find that insight?\nAre you familiar with dplyr and ggplot2, and ready to learn how unstructured text data can be analyzed within the tidyverse ecosystem?\nDo you need a flexible framework for handling text data that allows you to engage in tasks from exploratory data analysis to supervised predictive modeling?\nLearning objectives\nAt the end of this workshop, participants will understand how to:\nPerform exploratory data analyses of text datasets, including summarization and data visualization\nUnderstand and implement both sentiment analysis and tf-idf\nUse unsupervised models to gain insight into text data\nBuild supervised classification models for text using tidy data principles\nPreparation\nPlease tune into the workshop with a computer that has the following installed (all available for free):\nA recent version of R, available at https://cran.r-project.org/\nA recent version of RStudio Desktop (RStudio Desktop Open Source License), available at https://www.rstudio.com/download\nThe following R packages, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command line:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"tidytext\", \n                   \"gutenbergr\",\n                   \"stopwords\", \"stm\",\n                   \"tidymodels\", \"glmnet\", \n                   \"vip\", \"textrecipes\"))\n\n\n\nSlides\n00: Intro\n01: Text as tidy data\n02: More advanced EDA\n03: Topic modeling\n04: Supervised text models\nPast workshops\n16 October 2017 for Portland R-Ladies and Portland R User Group\n18 April 2018 for R-Ladies RTP\n22 May 2018 for III International Seminar on Statistics with R\n29 May 2019 for ASA Symposium on Data Science and Statistics\n27-28 January 2020 at rstudio::conf()\n10 February 2021 for National Institute of Statistical Sciences\nAcknowledgments\nThis website is made with distill and the slides are made with xaringan, both based on R Markdown.\nCorrections\nPlease submit an issue on the GitHub repo for this workshop if you find something that could be fixed or improved.\nReuse and licensing\nUnless otherwise noted (i.e.Â not an original creation and reused from another source), these educational materials are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY-SA 4.0.\n\n\n\n",
